Both projects claimed to be critiques of the National Security Agency and similar state-level spying operations, but in practice they reproduce the logic of surveillance itself, while normalising its actions and acclimatising audiences to its use. (Conversnitch largely anonymised its data and restricted it to short, untraceable phrases, but We Are Always Listening broadcast real locations and actual voices, which are still online at time of writing.) In my own work, I have had to confront the ethical dilemma that attempting to critique power through recuperation entails. The Right to Flight, 2014, was a four-month installation in London, which involved flying a military-grade surveillance blimp, equipped with video cameras, from the roof of a multi-storey arts venue. While the intention of the work was to explore the agency of aerial photography and—like the previously mentioned works—questions of surveillance and privacy, it quickly became apparent that the artwork had to be rethought to prevent it from repeating the same mistakes. Initially, all footage shot from the balloon was released publicly under open licenses, and audiences were encouraged to engage in discussions around the ethics of the project. But this was insufficient: the ethical burden in this case is not on the audience to respond, but on the artist to ensure that their actions do not replicate the very modalities they are attempting to question. Violating privacy, assuming privilege, recording data; doing surveillance in the name of art is still surveillance. Ultimately, I removed the cameras from the balloon, and replaced them with an anonymous, wifi-enabled file server: a device that did not capture information about audiences or passersby, and was instead of potential use to them. Self-critique of this kind, and the willingness to revise and rework projects, seems particularly necessary in a time when increasing numbers of artworks make claims to social critique while running on exactly the same substrates—technological and civil—as their subjects. The problem is not limited to the art world either, but recurs in all creative domains. In their book Speculative Everything: Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming, design educators Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby suggested a trajectory for their discipline that was less to do with problem-solving and thing-making, and more akin to storytelling: a series of proposals which, however fantastic, could bend the arc of history towards a desired outcome. By posing questions about the world rather than seeking to answer them, Dunne and Raby’s ‘speculative design’ seeks to unsettle the role products play in everyday life, particularly their all too common refusal to engage with the darkness and complexity of lived experience. An exemplary project, Robots, from the Technological Dream series, 2007, consisted of a series of objects whose behaviour changed in response to human activity: one sought out areas of low electromagnetic activity in the home, hiding from TVs and videos; another became agitated in"
